Non-legalese version:

You may do whatever you want with this, provided you

a) give proper credit (eg. "is based on the Mercenaries of Astonia engine by
Daniel Brockhaus" somewhere in your game / on your website)

b) do not make money with it

Contact me at daniel@brockhaus.org if you need a commercial license. I'd
also like to hear what you're doing with my work (but don't expect me to
actually check it out ;)).
