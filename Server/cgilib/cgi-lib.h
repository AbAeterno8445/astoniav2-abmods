 * Filename: cgi-lib.h
 * Program Library: CGI-LIB
 *
 * This header file contains all the functions that can be used to build a cgi program.
 *
 * This is the accompanying header file for the cgi-lib library. These function will assist
 * you in manipulating data that is transferred over the web. I have attempted to write
 * the code using ANSI standards.  This code can be compiled on a standard ANSI compiler
 * without any problems.  I have not included any system specific functions in order to make
 * it platform independent.

						both teh GET and POST method.
