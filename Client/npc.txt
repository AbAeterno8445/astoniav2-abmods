errno:

errno is set by svr_act.c only. it contains the result of the last action. the act_xxx() 
calls set it to ERR_NONE, while the (internally called) plr_xxx calls (or the functions 
called by them) set it to ERR_SUCCESS or ERR_FAILED.
If an action fails at act_xxx() level already, errno is set ERR_FAILED as well.
An action can fail at driver_generic level as well - so ERR_FAILED may be set there 
already.

group 1 contains all necessary characters which should never get attacked (merchants,
janitor etc.).
