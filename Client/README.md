# Mercenaries of Astonia v2 client - modified
Original code found at https://brockhaus.org/merc2.html. You will need to download the packaged graphic files from this site for the client to work properly.

You also need to move the images from gfx/overlays/ back into the gfx folder.

## Extra content
- Support for multiple resolutions and native windowed/fullscreen selection, along with larger map rendering distances.
- Character healthbars associated to the 'health' toggle.
- Little experience bar below exp number.
